/**
 * Script that runs after node modules have been installed, and Ngcc processed all packages.
 * This script updates the `package.json` files of Angular framework packages to point to the
 * Ngcc processed UMD bundles. This is needed because we run Angular in a `nodejs_binary`, but
 * want to make sure that Ivy is being used. By default, the NodeJS module resolution will load
 * the unprocessed UMD bundle because the `main` field of the `package.json` files point to the
 * View Engine UMD bundles. This script updates the `main` field in `package.json` files to point
 * to the previously generated Ivy UMD bundles.
 *
 * Ngcc does not by edit the `main` field because we ran it with the `--create-ivy-entry-points`
 * flag. It instructs Ngcc to not modify existing package bundles, but rather create separate
 * copies with the needed Ivy modifications. This is necessary because the original bundles
 * are needed for View Engine, and we want to preserve them in order to be able to switch
 * between Ivy and View Engine (for testing). Since the goal of this flag is to not modify
 * any original package files/bundles, Ngcc will not edit the `main` field to point to
 * the processed Ivy bundles.
