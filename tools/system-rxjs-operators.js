// Workaround for an issue where RxJS cannot be used with UMD bundles only. This is because
// rxjs only ships one UMD bundle and expects everyone to only use the named "rxjs" AMD module.
// Since our code internally loads operators from "rxjs/operators/index", we need to make sure
// that we re-export all operators from the UMD module. This is a small trade-off for not loading
// all rxjs files individually.

if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
  // Note that this needs to be in ES5, because we load it
  // directly into the browser without transpiling.
  define(['exports', 'rxjs'], function(exports, rxjs) {
    // Re-export all operators in this AMD module.
    Object.assign(exports, rxjs.operators);
  });
}
